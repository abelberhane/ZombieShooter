# Zombie Shooter

Game developed in C# and Visual Studio for a Zombie Shooter. While the Project I was reviewing let me know that this was an advanced project,
I felt as though the elements used in this game were very similar. I was required to utilize OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and 
had some interesting interactions with the bullet class. Nominal Change.

Working with a Progress Bar to show a Players health was new to me but the implementation was rather simple. I was able to change the Image 
shown depending on the Direction I needed to face. I was able to also learn how to dynamically populate Enemies and ammunition throughout
the map. 

Debugging was interesting and there were a few initial issues. Overall the development was enjoyable and I can already think of a few things
I cannot wait to try. I would like to implement a Restart button so I can play more than once. I also would like to continue working
around the bugs I encountered when I changed the backgrounds to a Street Image or some other background. I have included those images in the image
folder for future use.

Many thanks to the awesome group at MooICT. Assets and Project Idea originally from their website: http://www.mooict.com/c-tutorial-create-a-zombie-survival-shooting-game-in-visual-studio/
